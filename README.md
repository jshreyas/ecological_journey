# Ecological Journey

ü•ã _Train, Track, and Transcend_ ‚Äì A platform for martial artists to annotate, organize, and reflect on their journey with partners, clips, and insights.

## Features

- üé• **Video Archive**: Organize training footage by playlist, model, and partner.
- ‚úÇÔ∏è **Clip Manager**: Annotate key moments and tag techniques.
- üß† **Technique Tracker**: Track progress over time on specific techniques.
- üë• **Partner Journals**: View training logs and feedback across partners.
- üîé **Search & Filter**: Slice across metadata like playlist, model, or time period.
- üå± **Self-Hosted & Lightweight**: Runs with FastAPI + NiceGUI.

## Demo

üëâ [Live Demo](https://ecological-journey.onrender.com)

## üîÑ Lazy Login Flow (Render-Friendly)

- Backend sleeps on free Render plan
- Login triggers backend to wake
- UI displays:
  > ‚ÄúWaking up servers‚Ä¶ Please wait.‚Äù

This avoids failed login attempts and improves user clarity.

## Local Setup

### Basic Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jshreyas/ecological_journey.git
cd ecological_journey
cp .env.example .env  # configure backend and redis URLs

# Start services
docker-compose up --build
```

### Development Setup with Pre-commit

For contributors and developers, we recommend setting up pre-commit hooks for code quality:

```bash
# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt

# Install pre-commit hooks
pre-commit install

# Run all checks manually (optional)
pre-commit run --all-files
```

#### Pre-commit Hooks Include:

- **Black**: Code formatting
- **isort**: Import sorting
- **flake8**: Linting and style checking
- **mypy**: Type checking
- **bandit**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **pydocstyle**: Documentation style checking
- **prettier**: Frontend code formatting
- **hadolint**: Dockerfile linting

#### Running Individual Checks:

```bash
# Format code
black ui/ api/ tests/

# Sort imports
isort ui/ api/ tests/

# Lint code
flake8 ui/ api/ tests/

# Type check
mypy ui/ api/ tests/

# Security scan
bandit -r ui/ api/

# Documentation check
pydocstyle ui/ api/
```

#### Code Quality Script:

We provide a convenience script to run all checks:

```bash
./scripts/lint.sh
```

## Production Deployment (Render + Upstash)

- UI and API hosted on Render (free tier)
- Caching via Upstash Redis
- MongoDB via Atlas
- Lazy-login pattern with "Waking up server..." UX for cold start
